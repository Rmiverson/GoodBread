# GoodBread
### Recipe hoarding done right.

## About
GoodBread is recipe web application that aims to be the home for your recipes that your friends and family send you, and for the many recipes that fill up your bookmarks bar in your web browser. The goal is to make your recipes easy to organize, find, and share. Currently there are folders and tags to help organize recipes, as well as a dynamic recipe form to help write new recipes.
